# The Learning Game - MIS 426

This is an assignment for my MIS 426 course, a course taught at Oakland University.
We covered how to use GameMaker Studio in this course.

## Installation

Run the game in GameMaker 1.4. 

## How to play the game

You are a character named guy. Guy walks around and talks to other people and learns random facts. The goal of this game is to memorize what people tell you. 
After you talk to all of the characters, you then walk to the door and answer questions related to what all of the characters just told you.
